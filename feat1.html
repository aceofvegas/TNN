        <h1 class="article-title">Christie's Big Adventure: Chris Christie prepares for the biggest race of his career</h1>
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">By Tucker Lemon, TNN Senior Editor</h2>
		
        <p class="article-text">Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has announced his intention to run for president in 2024, setting up a potential clash with his former ally and rival Donald Trump. Christie, who was one of the first prominent Republicans to endorse Trump in 2016, has since distanced himself from the former president and criticized his role in the January 6th Capitol riot.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Christie said he decided to run for president after seeing the country divided and polarized by the current political climate. He said he wants to offer a vision of "common sense conservatism" that can appeal to a broad range of voters and restore trust in American institutions. He also said he is not afraid to take on Trump or any other candidate in the Republican primary.</p>
        <p class="article-text">A potential draft for his announcement speach says "I'm running for president because I love this country and I believe I can make a difference. I've proven that I can govern effectively, work across the aisle, and stand up for what I believe in. I've also proven that I can take a punch and give one back. I'm ready for this challenge and I'm ready to lead". </p>
        <p class="article-text">Christie's campaign will likely focus on his record as governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018, where he tackled issues such as pension reform, education, and disaster relief. He will also highlight his experience as a federal prosecutor and his role in the fight against terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. He will try to portray himself as a pragmatic problem-solver who can work with both parties and bring people together.</p>
        <p class="article-text">However, Christie will also have to overcome some challenges and controversies that have plagued his political career. He will have to answer questions about his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal, where his aides orchestrated a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge as an act of political retribution. He will also have to address his strained relationship with Trump, who reportedly mocked him for his weight and coronavirus infection. He will also have to compete with other prominent Republicans who may have more support and resources than him.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Christie's big adventure is just beginning, and he knows he has a long and tough road ahead of him. But he is confident that he can win over the hearts and minds of the American people with his message and personality.</p>
