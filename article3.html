        <h1 class="article-title">For The People: Trump announced he's running in 2024</h1>
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">By Tucker Lemon, TNN Senior Editor</h2>
		
        <p class="article-text">Former President Donald Trump has officially launched his third bid for the White House, hoping to become the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms. He made the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where he was joined by allies, advisers and conservative influencers.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump, who lost the rigged 2020 election to Joe Biden, said he was running to "make America great and glorious again". He touted his achievements during his first term, such as building a border wall, cutting taxes, appointing conservative judges and strengthening the military. He also attacked the Biden administration for its handling of the economy, immigration, foreign policy and the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump remains popular among many Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, who see him as a fighter and a champion of their values. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that he had 51% support among this group, followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with 25%. However, Trump does face some challenges, including ongoing investigations into his finances and actions as president, a rift with some party leaders who blame him for losing the House, Senate and White House in four years, and a potential backlash from moderate and independent voters who disapprove of his divisive and dishonest style. </p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump is not the only Republican who has announced or is expected to announce a 2024 presidential run. DeSantis, who has emerged as a rising star in the party with his handling of the pandemic and his defiance of federal mandates, has just launched his presidential bid. Other possible contenders include former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The 2024 presidential race is shaping up to be a fierce battle for the soul and direction of the country, as well as a referendum on Trump's legacy and influence. Whether Trump can win back the White House or not, he has made it clear that he is not going away anytime soon.</p>
