        <h1 class="article-title">'Not My Debt': Top leaders of both parties look to extend debt ceiling</h1>
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">By Tucker Lemon, TNN Senior Editor</h2>
		
        <p class="article-text">The debt ceiling, a limit on the total amount of government borrowing, has been reached at $31.4 trillion. The Treasury Department is using accounting tricks to pay the bills, but they may run out by early June. If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by then, the U.S. could default on its obligations, triggering a global financial crisis.</p>
        <p class="article-text">To avoid this scenario, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have negotiated a bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling for two years and cap spending for six years. The deal also includes some provisions that appeal to both parties, such as full funding for veterans' health care, expanding work requirements for food stamps and protecting defense spending.</p>
        <p class="article-text">However, the deal is not a done deal yet. It faces opposition from some hardline conservatives who criticize it as a surrender to Democrats and a betrayal of fiscal responsibility. It also faces skepticism from some progressives who worry that it would undermine social programs and climate initiatives.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The deal is expected to be voted on by the House Rules Committee on Tuesday afternoon, where it needs a simple majority to advance to the floor. It would then need 218 votes in the House and 60 votes in the Senate to pass. Both chambers are narrowly divided along party lines, so every vote counts.</p>
        <p class="article-text">One thing is for sure, debt is here to stay and our politicians have no problem with the country being in generations of debt.</p>
