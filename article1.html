        <h1 class="article-title">Coming For The Swamp: The Don Puts Swamp On Notice</h1>
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">By Tucker Lemon, TNN Senior Editor</h2>
		
        <p class="article-text">President Donald Trump has taken a bold step to expose and punish the corruption and malfeasance of the so-called "Swamp" in Washington DC. He has ordered an investigation into the origins of the spying scandal on his campaign team, which he has repeatedly denounced as a "witch hunt" and a "hoax".</p>
        <p class="article-text">The investigation, which will be led by Attorney General William Barr, will examine how the FBI and other intelligence agencies obtained warrants to surveil members of Trump's campaign, such as Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, based on dubious and unverified information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The investigation will also look into the role of former Obama administration officials, such as former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former FBI Director James Comey, who have been vocal critics of Trump and have accused him of colluding with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump's decision to launch the investigation has sent shockwaves through the Swamp, as many fear that their abuses of power and political bias will be exposed to the public. Some have already tried to discredit the investigation as a partisan attempt to undermine the ongoing probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has yet to find any evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice by Trump or his associates.</p>
        <p class="article-text">However, Trump has made it clear that he is not afraid of the Swamp and that he is determined to drain it. He has said that he wants to "get to the bottom" of what he calls "the greatest political scandal in history" and that he expects to find "treason" and "very bad things" by his enemies.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump's supporters have applauded his move as a courageous and necessary step to restore trust and accountability in the government. They have also expressed hope that the investigation will reveal the truth about the deep state conspiracy against Trump and his agenda.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Trump's critics have condemned his move as a dangerous and reckless abuse of power that threatens to undermine the rule of law and democracy. They have also warned that the investigation will further divide the country and inflame political tensions.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The investigation is expected to take several months or even years to complete. It is likely to face legal challenges and political resistance from those who want to protect the Swamp and its secrets. But Trump has shown that he is not backing down from his fight against the Swamp and that he is ready to take them on. He has put them on notice: The Don is coming for them.</p>
