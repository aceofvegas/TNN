        <h1 class="article-title">The Economy: Biden just can't seem to figure out</h1>
        <h2 class="article-subtitle">By Tucker Lemon, TNN Senior Editor</h2>
		
        <p class="article-text">The US economy has experienced a roller-coaster ride since President Joe Biden took office two years ago. On the one hand, the economy has rebounded strongly from the pandemic-induced recession, adding millions of jobs, growing at a fast pace, and boosting corporate profits and stock prices. On the other hand, the economy has also faced serious challenges, such as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and a widening trade deficit.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Not everything was rosy for the US economy under Biden. The most pressing problem was inflation, which soared to a **40-year-high** in 2021. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index (CPI) increased by **6.8%** in Biden's first 11 months in office. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by **5.5%** in the same period.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The inflation was driven by a combination of factors, such as supply chain bottlenecks, surging demand, higher energy costs, and fiscal stimulus. Although inflation has moderated slightly in recent months, it remains high and poses risks to consumer spending, business investment, and economic stability.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Another challenge for the US economy under Biden was the trade deficit, which continued to widen despite his efforts to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign imports. According to the Census Bureau, the trade deficit grew by **27.3%** in Biden's first 10 months in office, reaching a record high of $93 billion in October 2021. The trade deficit reflects the imbalance between what the US sells and buys from other countries, and it can have negative impacts on economic growth, jobs, and national security.</p>
